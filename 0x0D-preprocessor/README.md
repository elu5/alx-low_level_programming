The C Preprocessor

The C preprocessor modifies a source code file before handing it over to the compiler. You're most likely used tousing the preprocessor to include files directly into other files, or #define constants, but the preprocessor can also be used to create "inlined" code using macros expanded at compile time and to prevent code from being compiled twice.
